# CSCE121-502 Minesweeper
Extra credit project – an implementation of Minesweeper in C++, using FLTK for GUI.

Implemented by Blake Powell (-501) and Tristan Seifert (-502). See the "Design" directory for the initial and final design documents – both the original LaTeX documents and typeset PDF files are in there.

## How To Compile
Use the included build script to compile this Minesweeper program.

If you're unfortunate enough to have to compile this on the crappy Linux build servers, (or are one of those poor people stuck with gcc… my condolences to you) you'll have to use the `build-linux.sh` script. That has a slightly modified command line for GCC/Linux. If you're on macOS (or really, any other standards-conforming Unix platform, such as FreeBSD) you should use `build.sh` to compile. If you're trying to do this on Windows… good luck. I hope you don't value your sanity.

## Usage
All features marked as (Core) are integrated, as well as most other features. The shortcut for the debug mode is `shift + d`.
